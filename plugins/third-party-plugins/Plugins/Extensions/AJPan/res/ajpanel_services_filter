# Service Filter File ("ajpanel_services_filter"):
# - The file  is used to store yor favourite words.
# - It is automatically copied to your Backup directory when you launch the filter.
# - You can modify it within the Filter (Yellow Button) or use any text editor.
#
# Rules:
# - To find words, create line with a word (or list of words separate by commas).
# - Searching is case-insensitive (capital and small letters or a mix of both).
# - Starting the line with "^" will order the search for names starting with the words.
# - To find names that start with a word, add "^" as the first letter in line.
# - Comments are ignored (any text starting with "#" is ignored).
# - Empty lines are ignored.
#
# Examples:
# Sport			# Find names that contain the word "sport".
# sport, kass		# Find names that contain any of the words "sport" and "kass".
# ^k				# Find names that start with the letter "K" (or "k").
# ^sport,beIN		# Find names that start with the words "sport" or "beIN".
