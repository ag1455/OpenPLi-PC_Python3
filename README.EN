Attention! Make a full backup of your system.
=============================================

This only works on Ubunu 24.04 with the /proc virtual file system.
Intended for development only. There are few plugins yet, but this will probably help developers.

Supported software
==================
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS "Ubuntu on xorg".
E2PC works well with NVIDIA video cards using the "vdpau" video driver.
Please don't use ppa repositories containing system packages!

Installation
============
If necessary run scripts 1 ... 8 step by step. Either run INSTALL_ALL.sh.
All necessary libraries will be installed automaticly.
The working folder for the entry now is /media/hdd because often the sda3 drive is mounted in /home. This folder creates a link /media/hdd.
In this folder: /media/hdd, /media/hdd/movies, /media/hdd/icons, etc.
The downloaded keys are located in the /var/keys folder.

Start
=====
Run "autostart.sh" as super user.

Current issues
==============
1. When using multi standart dvb cards, for example HVR-4000, calling SatFinder or PoitionerSetup calls frontend1, rather than frontend0, as intended.
In SatFinder, you can switch the dvb card with the right-to-the-left arrows and then the signal appears, but it calling PoisonerSetup crash.
Most likely, the reason is that the enigma2 receivers using single tuners in different slots.
2. Teletext doesn't work through the framebuffer.
3. Timeshift doesn't work as we would like.
4. If you have Intel or AMD integrated GPU, use "opengl" video driver in the xine.conf.
5. E2pc will not work well with "noveau" NVIDIA driver.

Compilation tips
================
Keep in mind that you can run scripts if you associate yourself with an experienced user.
Note that no script can take into account all the features of your system. Therefore, you need patience, because there are possible unpredictable failures in the work of scripts.
If, for example, the log says that there is no such directory or file, then create it, and don't expect that I will correct it in the scripts. There is practically nothing to correct,
they work. Remember that any errors can be even in the original from git OpenPLi.
If you are building e2pc on legacy distributive, keep in mind that since the release date there have been many updates that could lead to crashes in the scripts.
If you have updated the libc-dev package, then need to restart the script 4. Otherwise, the next attempt the plugins will not compiled.
Since changes in enigma2 and plugins occur synchronously, need run the build scripts enigma2 and plugins every time after upgrade.
If you recompiled enigma2, be sure to recompile the plugins.
When you restarting to another version of Ubuntu, turn off the power, since firmware versions they are different, but remain in the memory of the dvb card.
If you want enigma2 to load immediately after the start, then put the autostart.sh script in the 'automatically starting applications' with the command: sudo /usr/local/e2/bin/autostart.sh.
If necessary, change the delay in the enigma2.sh script.
Please don't write to me that my hands are growing out of ass, and send me please real corrections. :)

Features
========
In order not to restart e2pc during crash and not to clutter up /home/hdd with logs, the following mechanism is used:
When you run the program, all crash logs are moved to /tmp. Then, the startup script runs in an infinite loop, and the check for the presence of a crash log file is added.
To restart, not one but two conditions are required: the appearance of the crash log file and the subsequent disappearance of the enigma2 process.
So, if enigma2 run in a circle, press F11 or Alt-F1 and then in the menu (install cairo-dock / classic menu) the icon "Kill Enigma2pc" and look at the crash log in /tmp.
Most often, this is an error during installation. For example, the absence of the desired folder or file as a result of an abnormal termination of the assembly script.
Also there is control a oscam crash.
