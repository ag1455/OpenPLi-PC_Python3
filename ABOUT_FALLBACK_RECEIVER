  Fallback receiver e2pc cannot receive stream directly, as xine only plays m3u streaming files.
However, if you download such a file by the OpenWebif plugin to the /tmp/mozilla_(user_name)0/*.m3u, then you can open this stream with a media player in e2pc,
by minimizing its window and opening a browser with SERVER_IP:80 in the home network through a router. But you have to do this every time if you want to watch
a different channel.
  Of course, this is very inconvenient, but you can create a list of your own channels using the JediMakerXtream plugin from a homemade m3u file,
which will look something like this:

  #EXTM3U
  #EXTVLCOPT--http-reconnect=true
  #EXTINF:-1,Hope TV
  #EXTVLCOPT:program=13227
  http://192.168.1.19:8001/1:0:19:33AB:3EB:1:C00000:0:0:0:

  Copy *.m3u to /usr/local/e2/etc/enigma2/jediplaylists and run the conversion plugin.
And after adding to favorites, you will have a new file with something like this name "userbouquet.jmx_live_stream.m3u_-_Uncategorised.tv":

  #NAME stream.m3u - Uncategorised
  #SERVICE 4097:0:1:014d:0120:0:0:0:0:0:http%3a//192.168.1.19%3a8001/1%3a0%3a19%3a33AB%3a3EB%3a1%3aC00000%3a0%3a0%3a0%3a:Hope TV
  #DESCRIPTION Hope TV
  ...

  Favorities list will open with a blue button in the channel list window.
W: Channels from the old list will not open!

Save the text, convert the new channel, insert two more lines into your list and save:

  #NAME stream.m3u - Uncategorised
  #SERVICE 4097:0:1:014d:0120:0:0:0:0:0:http%3a//192.168.1.19%3a8001/1%3a0%3a19%3a33AB%3a3EB%3a1%3aC00000%3a0%3a0%3a0%3a:Hope TV
  #DESCRIPTION Hope TV
  #SERVICE 4097:0:1:014d:0121:0:0:0:0:0:http%3a//192.168.1.19%3a8001/1%3a0%3a16%3a3401%3a3ED%3a1%3aC00000%3a0%3a0%3a0%3a:krone.tv
  #DESCRIPTION krone.tv

  You can later add unlimited channels to this file. This list can switches channels on the server!
If this topic is interesting, then we can exchange such lists and later massively change the IP to your own.
